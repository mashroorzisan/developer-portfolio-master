            <h3>Whats your hobby</h3>
            <p>Travelling is one of those few activities that has a kind of reset button in our lives. You go away for a
                few days or weeks and come back fresh and ready to take on challenges of life head on. Travelling to
                many people is a matter of convenience, rather than a recreation activity. They only travel when they
                have an issue to attend to. Travelling is also not for escapists, as many people tend to believe. I used
                the word ‘escapists’ not in the literary sense of the word, but rather to mean people who run away from
                their problems. Travelling is a hobby like any other.</p>
